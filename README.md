# Covariate Balancing with Measurement Error: R Code for Simulation and Real Data Analysis

This repository contains R code for the manuscript titled "Covariate Balancing with Measurement Error" by Xialing Wen and Ying Yan. The code includes simulation studies to demonstrate the covariate balancing methods proposed in the paper.

## Contents:
- **Simulation Studies:** R scripts for conducting Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the performance of our proposed correction techniques under different scenarios involving measurement error.

## Usage:
- To run the simulations, execute the corresponding R scripts in the simulation/ folder.

## Dependencies:
- List any R packages or libraries required to run the code (e.g., `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, etc.).
